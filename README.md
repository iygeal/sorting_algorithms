Background
---
This repository is dedicated to the study of Sorting Algorithms.  
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.

From the beginning of computing, the sorting problem has attracted a great deal of research, perhaps due to the complexity of solving it efficiently despite its simple, familiar statement.
